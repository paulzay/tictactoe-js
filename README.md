- 2nd turn ‚Äî Player 2.
- Player 2 places their token (O) in only 1 square of their choice, except they can‚Äôt touch the square that Player 1‚Äôs token already fills.
- 3rd turn- Player 1 ‚Ä¶. and the cycle continue until a player wins or there‚Äôs a tie game.
- There are 8 winning combinations: Top row, Middle row, Bottom row, Left column, Middle column, Right column, Left diagonal, and Right diagonal.
- There‚Äôs a draw/tie when the entire board is filled with X‚Äôs and O‚Äôs but no winning combinations can be found.
